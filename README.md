## Variable basics

### 1. Mastering syntax
- Create a file called `basics.js`. 
- In this file, define 3 variables: One should be of type String, another of type Number, and another of type Boolean.
- Print the values of these variables, each on its own line.
- Execute your JavaScript code using `node basics.js` on the command line to see whether everything works.

### 2. StubHub: Fixing redundancy

The following program has a lot of redundant calculations. Use variables to reduce the redundancy in the code.

```
console.log('Face value: ' + (45 + 75 + 125));
console.log('Selling price: ' + (45 + 75 + 125) * 1.5);
console.log('Seller fee: ' + (45 + 75 + 125) * 1.5 * 0.2);
console.log('Total profit: ' + ((45 + 75 + 125) * 1.5  - (45 + 75 + 125) * 1.5 * 0.2 - (45 + 75 + 125)));
```
